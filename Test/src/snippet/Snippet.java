	explain angular life cycle methods
	ChatGPT
	Angular is a popular framework for building dynamic web applications. It uses a component-based architecture, where components are the building blocks of an application's user interface. Angular components have a lifecycle consisting of various methods that are automatically called at different stages of a component's creation, rendering, and destruction. These lifecycle methods allow you to perform specific tasks or operations at different points in a component's lifecycle.
	
	Here is an overview of the key Angular lifecycle methods and when they are called:
	
	ngOnChanges:
	This method is called whenever the component's input properties change. It receives an object containing the previous and current values of the input properties. This method is often used to respond to input changes and update the component's internal state accordingly.
	
	ngOnInit:
	This method is called once, right after the component has been initialized and its inputs have been set. It's commonly used for initialization tasks such as retrieving data from services or setting up initial values.
	
	ngDoCheck:
	This method is called during every change detection cycle. It's a more general hook that allows you to perform custom change detection and additional checks. It's useful for scenarios where you need to manually determine if something in the component has changed.
	
	ngAfterContentInit:
	This method is called after Angular projects external content into the component's view, such as content projected using <ng-content>. It's useful for operations that need to be performed after projected content is available.
	
	ngAfterContentChecked:
	This method is called after Angular checks the projected content for changes. It's useful for reacting to changes in projected content or performing additional checks.
	
	ngAfterViewInit:
	This method is called after Angular initializes the component's view and its child views (if any). It's often used for tasks that require access to the component's view, like setting up third-party libraries that manipulate the DOM.
	
	ngAfterViewChecked:
	This method is called after Angular checks the component's view and its child views for changes. Similar to ngAfterContentChecked, it's used for responding to changes in the view or performing additional checks.
	
	ngOnDestroy:
	This method is called just before a component is destroyed. It's used to clean up resources, unsubscribe from observables, or perform any necessary teardown operations.
	
	These lifecycle methods provide hooks for you to manage your component's behavior at different stages of its existence. By implementing these methods in your components, you can control the logic and behavior of your Angular application effectively. Keep in mind that understanding these lifecycle methods is crucial for optimizing performance and managing resources correctly within your Angular application.
